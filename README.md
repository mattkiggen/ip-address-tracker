## üèÉ Run

To run the application you will first need to run the command `npm install` and then create a `.env` file that contains your api keys for [Google maps](https://developers.google.com/maps), as well as [Ipify](https://geo.ipify.org/).

The `.env` file should contain the following:

- `REACT_APP_API_KEY="your ipify api key here"`
- `REACT_APP_MAPS_API_KEY="your google maps api key here"`
